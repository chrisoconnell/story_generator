In the bustling tech hub of Neonspire, where skyscrapers glowed with holographic ads, lived a programmer named Alex Vega. Alex wasn’t your typical coder—he had a knack for solving problems that made others throw their keyboards in frustration. He worked for CyberShield, a company that protected the city’s digital infrastructure, and he spent his days sipping energy drinks and debugging code in his cluttered cubicle.

Traffic lights flashed red, cars piled up in gridlock, and water mains burst, flooding downtown. The mayor’s voice crackled over the city’s emergency broadcast: “We’re under a cyberattack! If we don’t fix this in 24 hours, Neonspire will be uninhabitable!”

The lead engineers traced the issue to a malicious virus that had infiltrated the AI’s core—a virus so complex it rewrote itself faster than they could analyze it. “We’re done for!” cried the CTO, slamming his laptop shut. But Alex, who’d been quietly sipping his third energy drink of the day, raised an eyebrow. “Let me take a look,” he said, cracking his knuckles.
